'It wasn't a dream,' Howard told himself now, in the cellar. It really had happened. He had seen Miss Blake's body, but he hadn't killed her. She was already dead when he first saw her.

He thought about the dragon again. He could almost see those red eyes shining in the dark. Then Howard went cold inside. There were eyes shining in the dark... here, in this cellar! They were watching him. Dragon's eyes? No, rats! He was terrified of rats. He felt around with his hands and found some pieces of wood. He threw them at the shining eyes, and shouted as loudly as he could.

Suddenly a voice came from above. Who's that? What's happening down there?

It was a police officer. 'Help me,' Howard said weakly. 'Please help me.'

I.a
ter, the Inspector was sitting beside his bed. She looked serious, but happier. Howard was in hospital again, and he was clean and warm and comfortable. He was glad that it was all finished.

They knew who he really was - Howard Thomson. They weren't calling him 'Blake' any more. Howard told them everything. Well, nearly everything. He couldn't say anything about Freddy. He was thinking of his sister Helen and the children. He didn't want to hurt them.

'Yes, I stole the green dragon,' Howard told the Inspector. 'I tricked the old lady with my story about a packet of tea, and she left the house.'

'Oh, yes?' said the Inspector, and stared at him. We found a note. Miss Blake left it by the telephone. It said "Mr Blake, Primrose Road". Your story isn't quite true, is it? You tricked the old lady - yes. But she let you into the house that evening. She didn't leave the house. And when she tried to stop you from taking the dragon, you...'

'No, no! That's not true. It was afternoon, not evening.' Howard had to stay calm. He had to say he was the thief, not Freddy. He spoke slowly, carefully. 'She left the house in the middle of the afternoon. I went in and stole the dragon. That's what happened, Inspector. I didn't kill her. I couldn't kill anyone - she was already dead when I saw her for the first time.'

'Already dead?' the Inspector said quickly.

'Yes, I...' Howard saw that he had made a mistake. He had to explain. 'I went back that night,' he said.

'You went back?' The Inspector didn't believe him.

'Why did you do that?'

<div>'I wanted to return the dragon, Inspector.' The words sounded weak and stupid. 'I was afraid of it, I don't know why, but it terrified me.'

'Oh, yes?' said the Inspector again, and looked hard at Howard with her cold, grey eyes.</div>
